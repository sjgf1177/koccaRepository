								<title>Java Service Wrapper Project History</title>


								<p>For those interested, this section will take the reader
								through a brief history of how the current Java Service Wrapper
								came to be.</p>

										<p>Early in 1999, after having played with Java for a few
										months, Leif Mortenson ran into a problem with a service that
										he had been developing. There was no way to install the Java
										application as an NT service.</p>

										<p>The solution was to write a replacement for the java
										executable which had the ability to be installed as a service.
										This version of the wrapper worked by loading the jvm.dll and
										then launching a new JVM instance using JNI.</p>

										<p>In October 1999, Leif joined a startup company called <a
											href="http://www.silveregg.co.jp">Silver Egg Technology</a>.
										Over the next year, Silver Egg developed a recommendation
										engine, called Aigent, for use in web site personalization. As
										Aigent was built in Java, it had the same problem with being
										installed as an NT service as some of Leif's previous
										projects. The Wrapper code was brought in from home and used
										as part of the Aigent product to provide that functionality.</p>

										<p>In March 2000, Ryan Shaw joined Silver Egg and brought
										with him a wealth of knowledge of the Linux OS. All platform
										specific portions of the Aigent product, including the
										Wrapper, were ported over to Linux. At this point was still a
										very simple tool for running installing a JVM as a service.
										Its usefulness on Linux was limited to making it easier to run
										the product on both platforms with common configuration files.

										<p>In November 2000. Aigent began having serious stability
										problems. The product would work perfectly for 2-3 weeks at a
										time. All memory and performance were perfectly flat. Then all
										of a sudden, the JVM would crash with a Hot Spot Access
										Violation. This was very bad as the product was installed at a
										couple customer sites at the time. A few weeks were spent
										trying to track down the problems. But no headway was made and
										the customers were getting tired of the procedure of having to
										restart their server every week to avoid the crash.</p>

										<p>Leif came up with the idea of modifying the Wrapper so
										that it would run the JVM in a spawned process rather than as
										a DLL. This way if the JVM process crashed or hung for any
										reason, the Wrapper process would still be alive and in a
										position to do something about it. This Wrapping and
										monitoring of the JVM process is where the Java Service
										Wrapper project got its current name. This new functionality
										turned out to be very useful on the Linux platform as well.</p>

										<p>After a few more months, the cause of Aigent crashing
										turned out to be an ArrayList which was not being synchronized
										correctly. The HotSpot compiler had optimized the code in such
										a way that if two threads accessed the ArrayList in a certain
										way at the same time, the JVM would crash. The code was
										accessed several times per second under load tests, so why it
										reliably took 2-3 weeks to reproduce is anyone guess. But the
										Wrapper had proved its usefulness by getting Aigent through
										its rough spell guaranteeing that any loss of service due to a
										JVM crash never lasted more than a few seconds.</p>

										<p>Realizing that the Wrapper would most like be very
										useful to a lot of other users, Ryan and Leif decided to give
										something back to the open source community. A project was
										registered on SourceForge and the Java Service Wrapper had its
										first public release in November 2001.</p>

										<p>The first version of the Wrapper was was not very
										flexible, having been designed for a few specific
										applications. Over the first few versions a lot of work was
										done to create documentation as well as adding several
										features to make it much more configurable.</p>

										<p>Within a month of the first release, the Wrapper was
										ported to its first new platform, Solaris.</p>

										<p>Johan Sorlin (Spocke) joined the project in January
										2002 after contributing a great new logging architecture which
										made it possible for the Wrapper to log to the Windows event
										log and Unix syslog.</p>

										<p>Being a company which provides middle ware software and
										services to other internet companies, Silver Egg felt the full
										brunt of the downward spiral in the post bubble internet
										market, and in April 2002 were forced to do a reorganization.
										They have since come back strong, but Ryan and Leif both chose
										to move on to new jobs while continuing to maintain the
										Wrapper as a project on SourceForge.</p>

										<p>In January of 2003, to reflect the fact that continuing
										development of the Wrapper was being done almost entirely by
										Leif, the decision was made to branch and then sub-license the
										Java Service Wrapper code base. The new <a href="license.html">license</a>
										was placed under the copyright of Tanuki Software, owned by
										Leif. In addition to simply giving credit where credit is due,
										this move was made to maintain control over the future
										availability and development of the Wrapper along with the
										code and ideas added after the branch.</p>

										<p>Packages were changed from com.silveregg.wrapper to
										org.tanukisoftware.wrapper. While the Silver Egg packages were
										deprecated, they were maintained as wrappers around the
										classes in the new packages to maintain forward compatibility
										for the user base.</p>

										<p>Over the last year, several users have offered to
										donate funds to help support the project. Of course the
										members of the team greatly appreciate any such contributions.
										So to make it easier, a PayPal account was opened to accept
										any and all donations.</p>

										<p>Version 3.0.0 also adds AIX and HP-UX to the list of
										supported platforms. Thanks to Ashish Gawarikar and William
										Lee for the patches.</p>
