										<p>The beginnings of the Java Service Wrapper were
										originally developed by Leif Mortenson starting in early 1999
										as a personal tool for private development projects. At this
										point it was completely closed source, existing only in a dark
										corner of a hard drive, as a small Windows-only tool that
										could be used to install a Java application as an NT service.
										</p>

										<p>Leif joined an internet startup, <a
											href="http://www.silveregg.co.jp">Silver Egg Technology</a>,
										in October of 1999. In early 2000, Leif brought the basics of
										what was to become the Wrapper in to work as it was a ready
										made to tool to solve the problem of being able to install
										Silver Egg's primary product as an NT service. Together with
										Ryan Shaw, another Silver Egg employee, significant
										improvements were made to the Wrapper over the following
										months as features such as error recovery and Linux support
										were added.</p>

										<p>In November of 2001, Silver Egg decided to open the
										Wrapper up as an open source project as a way to give
										something back to the community. As the majority of
										development to date had been contributed by Silver Egg, the
										Java Service Wrapper was released under Silver Egg copyright
										using a the generous MIT <a href="license-silveregg.html">license</a>.
										This initial release was version 2.2.0.</p>

										<p>Leif and Ryan continued to develop the Wrapper mainly
										on personal time until they both left the company in April of
										2002. At this point the Java Service Wrapper was at version
										2.2.6</p>

										<p>After leaving Silver Egg, Ryan has continued to provide
										some support for development. However the majority of
										development from this point was done by Leif, along with
										contributions from the growing Java Service Wrapper community.
										</p>

										<p>Development of the Java Service Wrapper continued under
										the <a href="license-silveregg.html">Silver Egg license</a>
										until January 2003, and version 2.2.9. At that point, to
										reflect the efforts that have gone into the development of the
										Wrapper, the source code was branched and sub-licensed to
										Tanuki Software, owned by Leif Mortenson, prior to releasing
										version 3.0.0.</p>

										<p>Unfortunately the first version of the Tanuki Software
										license, while also being an MIT license, was incomplete in
										that it did not include all required references to the
										original Silver Egg license. The license has since been
										updated to include all required copyright information.
										However, versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 were all released with
										the incomplete license. If you have in your possession a copy
										of such a license, please replace it with the complete <a
											href="#">Tanuki Software license</a> at the top of this page.
